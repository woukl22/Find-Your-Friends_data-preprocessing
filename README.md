In this project, we created a visualization tool that shows the relationship between validators within Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain networks and allows them to explore similar validators.


### Background
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: The more assets you have, the more permission you have to validate your work in that chain

- **Validator**: The validator is delegated the cryptocurrency from people who have it to verify the transaction.

- **Staking**: Investment method that delegate the validator to use his or her cryptocurrency for blockchain validation and receives compensation

- **Proposal**: Important decisions within the chain are made by proposal voting.

Based on the proposal voting of validators, we tried to understand their tendencies and friendly relations.


### Result
The relationship between the validators and the tendency between the chains could be confirmed. Through this system, users can find validators similar to the validators they are investing in.<br>

However, there are many inconveniences in searching for validators, and additional interactions such as filtering functions are needed. Additional data analysis and processing are required.
